Project Pokedex

Wireframe can be found here: https://wireframe.cc/MFG4Qj


Created a basic pokedex with three pokemon inside.

The pokemon info was pulled via ajax call from the public pokemon api(https://pokeapi.co/).
The click me button only console.logs what pokemon you called via click on the gifs on top of the page.
Please have browser console open to see what it does.
The console.log output will refresh on browser refresh and at the moment, will store duplicates of the pokemon if clicked 
on multiple times.
